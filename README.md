# College Degree ROI by Gender

üìä **Overview**  
This project uses 2022 IPUMS microdata to analyze the difference in earnings between men and women with bachelor‚Äôs degrees. The analysis focuses on how degree field and gender impact average earnings.

üë®‚Äçüíª **Tools Used**  
- R  
- dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, stargazer  
- Data from IPUMS 2022

üß† **What I Did**  
- Filtered bachelor degree holders working full-time (30+ hours)
- Calculated average earnings by degree and gender
- Measured gender pay gap across fields
- Ran linear regressions for:
  - All degrees
  - Male-dominated fields
  - Female-dominated fields
- Visualized earnings vs gender ratios

üìà **Key Findings**
- Male-dominated degrees have higher average earnings for both genders
- There is a consistent gender pay gap across most degree fields
- Female-dominated degrees tend to pay less on average
